            Why I Prefer Having No Sexual Partner
        </h1>
        <p>
            Many people ask me why I do always prefer to have no sexual nor
            intimate partner in my life. I receive questions like:
            "Do you live with your partner?", "Do you have a boyfriend?",
            "Are you in love?", etc. with the purpose of finding out
            whether I would date them (those who ask).
            Simply put, 
            <b>
                I have had sex with a lot of men BUT I have never 
                fallen in love with any of them
            </b>. 
            And I really suspect
            that someday I will find a man who is worth loving.

            Unfortunately, all the men whom I have met in my life have weaker
            mental skills than I do. I will not accept to get involved into a 
            relationship with a guy who doesn't even know how to apply

            seems to be hard-to-understand by all those good-looking men you meet
            in your life. They only have muscles. But intelligence? they are just stupid.

            Whenever I get into a philosophical discussion with those men, or even

            or whatever field of study I am interested in, I realize that I am
            speaking to an unlettered person. They want to be my man, while they don't even know
            what

            try hard to be dumb enough when I talk with them so that they don't 
            feel bad about themselves.
            This is not practical in the long term as
            conversations quickly become very silly and boring.

            I started to practice computer programming since I was 13 years old.
            I did my hobby OS when I was at high school, even before joining a CS
            school. 
            <b>I was the top student over my CS class, with a very high GPA.</b>
            I studied 61 courses in university, spanning very wide areas of
            Computer Science and Automatic Control. I have knowledge in Math, Statistics,
            Computer Science, Electronics Engineering, Computer Architecture,
            Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, Sociology, Gender and Sexuality
            Studies, Physics, Chemistry, History, Islamic Studies, Biology,
            and many other fields. What do you know? VOID. We don't even share
            any area of interest! All what you can talk about is how the arse
            of a random lady you have seen in the subway train is big.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a highly-educated, smart gay man. I am not complimenting myself;
            all the records confirm what I have just said. I will not fall
            in love with a warehouse worker who shares no interests with me
            just because they have muscles.

            I always have something to tell about myself. My history is full of
            interesting stories where I mostly won in the end:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                My CS studies and how I topped my colleages.

            <li>
                My life in military as a gay man!

            <li>
                How I managed to overcome the military crisis.
            </li>

                My story with Valeo.
            </li>
            <li>
                My story with my last employer in Egypt, and the red hair crisis.

            <li>
                How I escaped from Egypt to Canada in a very smart way.

            Now what are your accomplishments? Your visit to Las Vegas last summer
            and the couple of sexual adventures you had right there? Do you think that
            such a sick kind of man will attract me? Unfortunately you were
            just born to find yourself a Canadian white man, with everything
            easy and accessible (except Ontario's health care system); 
            and the pride took you to think that you can
            date any woman you like. Then you grow up to find out that you
            are just a number. And now you are trying to approach me to feel
            good about yourself if I show any sign of interest in you.
            I am sorry... I am not interested.

            I even did much more than that with my computer. I'm sorry, you are not

            If you are living with us in this world, you must have heard once that
            women are looking for a man who loves her for herself, not her body.
            Unfortunately, those women are looking for a hypothetical man that has never
            existed.

            We, as women, decided
            to treat you the same way; and the results are amazing: we
            can see the signs of low self-confidence on the face of every man in
