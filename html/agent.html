            "The effectiveness of a computer program based on animated
            pedagogical agent in the remedy of reading and writing difficulties
            of children with learning disabilities in primary stage" is
            a PhD thesis by Dr. Maha Badr at Damanhour University,
            Faculty of Education, Curriculum and Methodology Department.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this research, Dr. Maha shows how such computer program is
            really effective in treating the learning difficulties of
            pupils. As part of the study, a computer program with those
            specification was to be built and
            tested on a sample of children.
            My mission was to design and implement
            this program (in Arabic) which was based on an
            interactive pedagogical agent which was called "Mona".
        </p>
        <p>
            The graphical animations were designed
            by a grapics designer and the voices were recorded in a special
            studio. I did all the programming needed to make the agent a
            typical interactive computer
            teacher and to make the education content interactive.
            Dr. Maha designed
            the content in her thesis and we implemented it together. It was
            an interesting task as I learnt a lot about scientific research
            and how computer science could help other sciences.

        <h2>Exploratory experiment</h2>

        <p>
        In 2010/2011, the researcher did an exploratory experiment on the
        program by
        applying it on 12 children with learning difficulties. The sample
        was chosen from Ibn Sina School, Alexandria. The researcher found
        that:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>
        Students faced problems in understanding the instructions of Mona in
        the chapter of "demonstratives", so we added more demonstration.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
        Students faced problems in reading some sentences in
        "Re-arrange and form with Mona" because font was small. So we
        modified the size of the font.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
        Students faced some technical problems in the program and we worked on
        solving it.
        </p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Procedures of the fundamental research experiment</h2>
        <ul>

        <li>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>
        To find the effectiveness of the proposed computer program in
        the remedy of learning difficulties of a sample of 4th stage students.
        </p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <h3>Sample:</h3>
        <p>
        In 2011, Dr. Maha chose 80 students from two schools in Alexandria:
        Glal Desouky School and Mansour Hussien School. The students
        were split into three groups:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Experimental Group A</b>: 25 students.</li>
            <li><b>Experimantal Group B</b>: 25 students.</li>
            <li><b>Standard Group</b>: 30 students.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        This was decided based on a lot of research procedures that the
        researcher did on 236 students at the mentioned shools. After
        diagnostic tests, it was shown that the selected students had
        difficulties in Arabic.
        </p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <h3>Implementation:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>
        The researcher first applied a set of tests to find the characteristics
        of students.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        Information of students and their difficulties was inserted in the
        database.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        The program was installed on the computers in the computer labs of the
        mentioned schools. The labs were prepared for the experiment, thanks
        to the teachers of both schools who really helped the
        researcher so much.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        For group A, the program was configured to <b>show</b> the agent.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        For group B, the program was configured to <b>hide</b> the agent.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        Dr. Maha started to teach the students of
        both groups how to use the program.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        The experiment took two months. The students finished all the
        study plans that were set by the program.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        During the experiment, the researcher noted that the students
        really interacted with the program and they had desired to
        continue learning with the program. The agent largely affected
        the interaction between group A and the program.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        The researcher then applied the diagnostic tests on both groups,
        the tests showed different results than the tests that were performed
        on the students before they used the program.
        </li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>Research results</h2>
        <p>
        Using a set of statistical methods like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheffe's_method"
           target="_blank">Scheffe`'s method</a> and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANCOVA"
           target="_blank">ANCOVA</a>, the researcher got to the following
        conclusions:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>
        The proposed program which is based on the pedagogical agent
        is
        <b>highly effective</b>
        in treating the reading and writing difficulties
        of the fourth grade students with learning disabilities.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        The appearance of the persona of the animated pedagogical agent
        on the interface of the program adds social dimension to the
        instructional situation and helps in the remedy of learning
        difficulties of children and improves their performance
        <b>better than non-appearance of its persona</b>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        The effectiveness of the proposed program isn't limited to the total
        score of the diagnostic test, but it
        <b>spreads to the different dimensions
        of the test</b>; which included the reading and writing difficulties
        (letter discrimination - word discrimination - comprehension - writing).
        The close results between the first and fourth dimensions indicate the
        positive impact by the appearance of the persona of the animated
        padagogical agent on the interface of the program on the performance
        of students.
        </p></li>
        </ol>
